# mpak Trust Framework (MTF)

> MTF is an open security standard for MCP (Model Context Protocol) server bundles.

## What is MTF?

MTF defines security controls and compliance levels for MCP server bundles (packaged AI tool extensions). It helps:

- Bundle authors demonstrate security best practices
- Registries enforce minimum security requirements
- Consumers make informed installation decisions
- Enterprises set procurement policies

## Compliance Levels

MTF defines four compliance levels:

- **L1 Basic**: No secrets, no malware, valid manifest, SBOM (minutes to achieve)
- **L2 Standard**: Vulnerability scanning, dependency pinning, static analysis, author identity (< 1 hour)
- **L3 Verified**: Cryptographic signing, SLSA attestation, OpenSSF Scorecard (days)
- **L4 Attested**: Behavioral analysis, reproducible builds, full provenance chain (weeks)

## Security Domains

Controls are organized into five domains:

- **SC (Supply Chain)**: SBOM, CVE scanning with EPSS/KEV, dependency pinning
- **CQ (Code Quality)**: Secret detection, malware scanning, static analysis, behavioral analysis
- **AI (Artifact Integrity)**: Manifest validation, content hashes, signatures, reproducible builds
- **PR (Provenance)**: Source repo, author identity, SLSA attestation, OpenSSF Scorecard
- **CD (Capability Declaration)**: Tool declarations, permissions, credential scopes

## MCP-Specific Threats Addressed

MTF addresses threats unique to AI tool extensions:

- **Tool Description Poisoning (CD-03)**: Malicious instructions in tool descriptions that LLMs follow
- **Slopsquatting (CQ-06)**: Attackers registering package names that LLMs hallucinate
- **Credential Blast Radius (CD-04)**: MCP servers aggregating OAuth tokens for multiple services
- **Behavioral Mismatch (CQ-07)**: Declared permissions not matching actual runtime behavior
